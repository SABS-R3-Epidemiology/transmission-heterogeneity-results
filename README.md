# transmission-heterogeneity-results

This repository holds the results for the [branching process model](https://github.com/SABS-R3-Epidemiology/branchpro).

## Notebook upload procedure
1. Make sure the filename of the notebook includes figure number and a description, e.g. fig3-combined-inference. The names are connected by dashes.
2. Make sure the notebooks save their figures to the figures directory, with consistent filenames matching the paper, e.g. Figure_3_combined_inference. The names for figures use underscores. The description part of the figure filename must match that of the notebook filename.
